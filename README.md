# Welcome to My Experimental Portfolio!

This website is a creative experiment built primarily with the help of AI (ChatGPT). It serves as a personal exploration into the capabilities of artificial intelligence—how well it understands feedback, adapts to evolving ideas, and supports the development process.

## Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project is twofold:

- **To test how much I can rely on AI for building and iterating on real-world applications.**
- **To create a centralized hub for useful tools that developers often need to solve, track, or simplify everyday tasks.**

## Ongoing Updates

As I continue to learn and grow, this site will evolve with me. I’ll be regularly updating it with new tools, features, and insights from my journey as a Computer Science engineer.

Stay tuned and feel free to explore the tools and experiments I’ve built so far!
